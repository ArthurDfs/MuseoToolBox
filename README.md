 MuseoToolBox is python files which are made to manipulate easily raster, with OTB inside.
In ancient Greek religion and myth, [Museo is the son and disciple of Orfeo](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museo_(autore_mitico)).
                                                              

For now, it only ease the creation of Satellite Image Time Series with [Sentinel-2 L2A Theia Data](https://github.com/olivierhagolle/theia_download) and of a custom sample time file (for those who need to resample their data temporally).
