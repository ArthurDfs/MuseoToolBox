	abstract = {Planning actions for species conservation involves working at both an ecologically meaningful spatial scale and a scale suitable for implementing management or conservation plans. Animal populations and conservation policies often operate across wide areas. Large-extent spatial datasets are thus often used, but their analyses rarely deal with problems inherent to spatial datasets such as residual spatial autocorrelation, which can bias or even reverse results. Here we propose a procedure for analysing a large-scale count dataset integrating residual spatial autocorrelation in a Generalized Linear Model framework by combining and extending previously published methods. The first step concerns the selection of the environmental variables by a modified cross-validation procedure allowing for residual spatial autocorrelation. Then the second step consists in evaluating the spatial effect of the model using a spatial filtering approach based on the variogram parameters. We apply this method to the Black kite (Milvus migrans) to estimate the distribution and population size of this species in France. We found some divergence in estimated population size between spatial and non spatial models, as well as in the distribution map. We also found that the uncertainty of the model was underestimated by the residual spatial autocorrelation. Our analysis confirms previous results, that residual spatial autocorrelation should be always accounted for, especially in conservation where false results may lead to poor management decisions.},

	abstract = {Spatially explicit information on tree species composition of managed and natural forests, plantations and urban vegetation provides valuable information for nature conservationists as well as for forest and urban managers and is frequently required over large spatial extents. Over the last four decades, advances in remote sensing technology have enabled the classification of tree species from several sensor types. While studies using remote sensing data to classify and map tree species reach back several decades, a recent review on the status, potentials, challenges and outlooks in this realm is missing. Here, we search for major trends in remote sensing techniques for tree species classification and discuss the effectiveness of different sensors and algorithms based on a literature review. This review demonstrates that the number of studies focusing on tree species classification has increased constantly over the last four decades and promising local scale approaches have been presented for several sensor types. However, there are few examples for tree species classifications over large geographic extents, and bridging the gap between current approaches and tree species inventories over large geographic extents is still one of the biggest challenges of this research field. Furthermore, we found only few studies which systematically described and examined the traits that drive the observed variance in the remote sensing signal and thereby enable or hamper species classifications. Most studies followed data-driven approaches and pursued an optimization of classification accuracy, while a concrete hypothesis or a targeted application was missing in all but a few exceptional studies. We recommend that future research efforts focus stronger on the causal understanding of why tree species classification approaches work under certain conditions or – maybe even more important - why they do not work in other cases. This might require more complex field acquisitions than those typically used in the reviewed studies. At the same time, we recommend reducing the number of purely data-driven studies and algorithm-benchmarking studies as these studies are of limited value, especially if the experimental design is limited, e.g. the tree population is not representative and only a few sensors or acquisition settings are simultaneously investigated.},
